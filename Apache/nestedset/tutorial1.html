	<li><h2>Preparation</h2>

	You're gonna want to have a JVM and Postgres or MySQL or some other RDBMS installed to do this.
	If you are using Oracle or DB2 you should use their built in Adjencency list operators instead. 

	<p>

	<li><h2 id="m">Motivation</h2>
		
	The idea behind this project came from an article by Joe Celko in his excellent book, SQL for
	Smarties.  

	<p/> 
	<b>What is a Nested Set?</b><br/> 
	The Nested Set is an adjacent list realized in SQL as a tree.  For a good slide show on the
	Nested Set theory check this <a
		href="http://research.calacademy.org/taf/proceedings/ballew/sld011.htm">site</a> out. 

	<p/> 
	<b>Why bother with a Nested Set?</b><br/> 
	Imagine a filesystem program that stores its data in a Relational Database Table.  Presumably,
	this table would have at least two columns, one being the unique id of the item, and the second
	being the id of the object's parent.  Additionally, the <b>id</b> is usually the primary key and
	the <b>parentId</b> is referentially constrained to values in the set of <b>id</b>
	<p/> 
	<img src="nodes.jpg"/>
	<p/> 
	The top of the tree is called the root. The nodes of the tree that have no subtrees beneath them are
	called the leaf nodes. The descendants, or children, of a parent node are every node at all lower
	levels in the subtree that has the parent node as its root.  In the table the data looks like
	this:
	<pre>
id    parentId
______________
1     null | 0
2         1
3         1
4         2
5         2
6         3
7         2
8         7
</pre>

	<p/> 
	This approach is a pretty standard list linking used in Online Transaction Processing type
	databases.  It   works pretty well, and doesn't require a lot of integrety checks.  Make sure the
	parentId points to a valid id and you're set.  Consider again the filesystem program.   It would
	have the following use-cases.  
	<p/> 
	<ol>
		<li>User browses a node.</li>  
		<li>User adds a node below an existing node.</li>  
		<li>User deletes a node and all of its children.</li>  
		<li>User moves a node to beneath another node.</li>  
		<li>User searches all nodes beneath a single node.</li>  
	</ol>
	<p/> 
	The Linked-List approach works great for <b>-1-</b>, cause all you have to do is the O(1) query: 
	<pre>SELECT * FROM table WHERE parentId = node;</pre> 

	And the Linked-List approach works well for use-case <b>-2-</b>, as all you have to do is
	something like this, again an O(1) statement: 
	<pre>INSERT INTO table ( id, parentId ) VALUES ( newId, NODE );</pre> 

	But things just totally fall apart in use case <b>-3-</b> there is no easy or efficient way to 	
	implement this using the Linked list.  Most solutions for this problem drop into a stored
	procedure or use a middle tier using some iterative loop or a stack.  The farther down the tree
	you have to go, the longer the statement runs.  

	<p/> 
	Most solutions to this problem are unelegent hacks that take too long and often leave the RDBMS
	integrity in a vulnrable state while its running.   One elegent way to do this still using the
	linked list approach is to use in a recursive trigger like <a href="recurseTrigger.sql.html">this</a> 
	to handle the parent/child stuff.  Its still not really that fast, but it does keep all the logic
	in the RDBMS instead of in an outside method. 

	<p/> 
	For use case <b>-4-</b> you can use: <pre>UPDATE table SET parentId = NODE;</pre> which is also
	very quick and easy. 
	<p/>
	However, you're fucked again for use case <b>-5-</b>.  This is a big problem, as most users expect to
	get search information back quickly.  If you are running some sort of EIS system where people are
	constantly searching through deeply nested set of relational information you will soon be fired.
	This means we have to find an O(x) or quicker algorithm, or rethink the data schema.   As very
	few DBA's have the luxury of rewriting their schemas on a whim, you have to think up a quick and
	easy way to improve the performace of the system without messing up your legacy stuff.  This is
	why you want to use the Nested Set Model. 

	<p/>
	<li><h2 id="t">Theory</h2>
	<b>How do you use Nested Sets? </b><br/> 
	Now, in the above diagram the data was shown as a tree of nodes.  You can also think  
	the data as a <b>set</b>.  Which, is actually a lot more SQL friendly as SQL is a set-based
	language.  Using the same table as about imagine a group of encompassing sets like this:  
	<br/> 
	<img src="set.jpg" height="200" width="300" title="Set"/>
	<p/> 
	<p/> 
	You see that the root, node number 1 is the largest set and contains every other node in the
	system.  So, how do we represent this in SQL?  We do it using a number line where each set is
	given a left and right hand bounds.  
	<p/>
	<img src="line.jpg" height="200" width="500" title="Set"/>
	<p/> 
	For example, below you can see the following: 
	<ul> 
		<li> The larger the range between left and right the more children the node has.</li>
		<li> Right - Left is always negative. </li>
		<li> MAX(Right)/2 == MAX(*) </li>
	</ul>
	Now, that being said the selection of all nodes in an arbitrarily deep nest is done very simply.
	Generally, this query will be used to feed some other query's in clause or as a constraint for a
	DML statement.
	<pre>
SELECT 
  n0.nid
FROM 
  NestedSet n0,
  NestedSet n1
WHERE 
    n1.nid = 0
AND	n0.lft BETWEEN n1.lft AND n1.rft;
</pre>
	<p/>
	<li><h2 id="si">SQL Implementation</h2>
	The Nested Set implementation will most likely be used as an indexing scheme to provide better
	access times for an existing system.  The nested set table may o
<pre>
Table "nestedset"
 Column  |  Type  | Notes  
---------+--------+-----------
nid      | bigint | Primary Key 
parentId | bigint | Foreign Key (nestedSet.nid)
rft      | bigint | Unique Key 
lft      | bigint | Unique Key 
</pre>
	<b> </b><br/> 
	<p/>

	<b>What's the downside to using Nested Sets? </b><br/> 
	<ul>
		<li>
		Increased integrity concerns.  Longer and more complex full table writes on each node
		mutation leave time for the 
		</li>
		<li>Heavy index maintainance cost on insert and delete. </li>
	</ul>
	<p/>

	<li><h2 id="ji">Java Implementation</h2>
	<b>Introduction</b><br/> 
	I am going to present the Java Implementation as schema independent as possible, to the end, all
	the returned values from the imaginary tables in the example will be done a Lists of Maps where
	each item in the List corresponds to a row in the resultset, and each row in the Map corresponds
	to a column with a discrete datatype.   This is pretty portable.   
	<p/> 

	<b>Prime the NestedSet</b><br/> 
	Before you can use the NestedSet schema, you need to determin the scope of it.  That is, how many
	tables will be represented by the nested set, and do they all share a unique namespace?
	<p/> 
 <pre> 
// First we need to assure the language is loaded.
CREATE FUNCTION plpgsql_call_handler () RETURNS OPAQUE AS '/usr/local/pgsql/lib/plpgsql' LANGUAGE C; 
CREATE TRUSTED LANGUAGE plpgsql HANDLER plpgsql_call_handler; 

// Now create the functions you'll need for operation.      
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION closeGap(BIGINT) RETURNS INTEGER AS '  
DECLARE r RECORD;  
BEGIN  
  SELECT INTO r * FROM nestedSet WHERE nid = $1;    
  UPDATE nestedSet  
  SET  
  lft = CASE  
    WHEN lft > r.lft  
    THEN lft - (r.rft - r.lft 1 )  
  ELSE lft END,  
  rft = CASE  
    WHEN rft > r.lft  
    THEN rft - (r.rft - r.lft 1 )  
  ELSE rft END;  
RETURN 1;  
END;  
' LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';  
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION deleteSubtree(BIGINT) RETURNS INTEGER AS '  
DECLARE r RECORD ;  
BEGIN  
  SELECT INTO r * FROM nestedSet WHERE nid = $1;  
  DELETE FROM NestedSet  
  WHERE lft BETWEEN r.lft AND r.rft;  
  RETURN 1;  
END;  
' LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';
