Apache 2.0 Module Developer Tutorials

Introduction

	I started this tutorial because while I was trying to
	learn module development I could not find any "from
	scratch" tutorials on module writing.  Documentation
	does exist, but I could not find any that showed how
	to start a module from nothing.

	So, here it is - everything I discovered and learnt
	while starting down the module road.

Warning

	I consider myself a decent programmer, but my history
	with C is limited so take everything you see here with
	a grain of salt.  I promise that I have committed a
	cardinal sin here somewhere and a Slashdot troll is
	just waiting to point out!  I make no apologies -
	I just hope that I've saved someone half an hour by
	putting this out.  Cheers!

Where To?

	See the following subdirectories for each of the
	tutorials.  I've decided that each tutorial will be
	free-standing and immutable once I've completed it,
	for no other reason than I want to document not just 
	the "how" to do something, but also the "how *not*"
	to do something.  So, as new tutorials are written I
	want to refer to previous tutorials so the reader can
	compare the content and therefore come away with more
	knowlegdge.

	tut1			A barebones module that does nothing except
						write a silly message to stderr (meaning
						error_log) when a GET request is processed.
						
						The reason this module is so trivial is
						because most of the tutorial focusses on
						the build environment and the logistics of
						compiling a kernel and getting it loaded
						into Apache.
