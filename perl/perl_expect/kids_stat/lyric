What happened to I'm sorry 
And I love you 
What happened to pay me back 
When you can 
What happened to let's wait 
Until we're married 
What happened to a boy growing 
Up becoming a man 

People don't pray no more 
People don't smile no more 
People don't love no more 
Because they've lost their 
Hearts, hearts, hearts 
Because they've lost their 
Hearts 

What happened to waking up 
On sunday morning 
Mama in the kitchen singing 
Gospel songs 
What happened to let's talk 
Instead of fighting 
And making it home before 
The street lights came on 

People don't speak no more 
People don't laugh no more 
People don't love no more 
Because they've lost 
Their hearts, hearts, 
Hearts 
Because they've lost 
Their hearts, hearts, hearts 
Because they've lost 
Their hearts 

Lord I know it's not 
Supposed to be this way 
You're the only one that 
Can take this pain away ( this pain away) 
So we can feel your grace 

Then we can smile again 
The we can laugh again 
Then we can sing again 
We won't have to worry 
No 
Then we can dance 
Again 
Then we can love again 

Cause you gave us back 
Our hearts, hearts, hearts 
Cause you gave us back our hearts, (we worship you) 
Hearts, hearts 
Cause you gace us back our 
Hearts
